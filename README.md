Discoveries so far:
- Players take turns to roll the dice
- They move forward as many as the dice result
- A question is asked (pop, science, sports or rock) each turn
- Correct answer gets them a gold coin 
- Wrong answer gets them in the penalty box
- Odd dice seems to get them out of the penalty box
- They will be asked a new question only if they can get out of the box 
- No question if even dice while in the penalty box
